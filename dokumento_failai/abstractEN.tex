Nowadays, as the world becomes more and more digitized, cyber security is a major issue. As a result, states, businesses and corporations are increasingly investing in cybersecurity. Ef{}forts are being made to prevent situations that could harm consumers, businesses or even countries. Tools are developed to help prevent such situations, analyze systems and identify gaps.

The purpose of this work is to create a secure vulnerability scanning tool that can safely scan the Internet
site, its system and its files, and provide information about the scan results.

This paper introduces a secure vulnerability scanner for auditing systems and websites..
It also presents an analysis of related work that reveals best practices of other scanners and their implementation in this scanner.
In addition, the methods of vulnerability and bug analysis, their analysis and implementation in the scanner are presented.
The scanner was developed using C\# programming language, .NET Core and Angular frameworks, Docker container technology, Microsoft SQL database.
A vulnerability scanner can detect external system vulnerabilities and malicious software in web site files.
It is also capable of detecting whether a website is safe to visit, its open directories or pages that users should not have access to.
Scanner security is ensured by container technology, which ensures that malware does not enter the scanner system when scanning website files or performing other scanning operations.
