abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have become one of the most common countermeasures in the network security arsenal. But while other technologies such as firewalls and anti-virus provide proactive protection, most current IDSs are passive; detection of a suspected intrusion typically triggers a manual response from a system administrator. Too often, this comes too late.},

abstract = {What You See Is Not What You eXecute: computers do not execute source-code programs; they execute machine-code programs that are generated from source code. Not only can the WYSINWYX phenomenon create a mismatch between what a programmer intends and what is actually executed by the processor, it can cause analyses that are performed on source code to fail to detect certain bugs and vulnerabilities. This issue arises regardless of whether one's favorite approach to assuring that programs behave as desired is based on theorem proving, model checking, or abstract interpretation.},
